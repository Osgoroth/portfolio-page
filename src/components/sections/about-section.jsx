            My name is David Lucas. I am a highly motivated and adaptable web

            management skills gained from my experience teaching in China. Im
            passionate about technology and I love being on two wheels whenever

            I am currently seeking a junior web developer position. My goal is
            to contribute my technical expertise and creative skills to a
            collaborative team, which would allow me to further my knowledge and
            grow in the field of web development to deliver impactful solutions
            to meet the clientsâ€™ needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for web development started in secondary school when I took
            IT at GCSE level, although I took a different path after studying
            Computer Science at Universtity my passion for developing website
            has resurged and I am now fully motivated to persue a career as a
            web developer.
